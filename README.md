Waterfall Logging for your data cleaning needs

## Motivation:
For a leaner and more efficient process. Also, because G does not like making waterfalls

## Inspired by:
- Adina's idea to put the waterfall results in a df, instead of going back and forth with your doc / sheet tab is very efficient!!
